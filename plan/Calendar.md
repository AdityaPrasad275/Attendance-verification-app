## Google Calendar Integration Plan

The Google Calendar integration feature allows students to synchronize their class schedules and events with their Google Calendar. This integration provides a seamless experience for managing and organizing their schedules. Below is an outline of the implementation plan for the Google Calendar integration:

1. **Authorization and Authentication**: Implement the necessary authentication process to allow users to connect their Google accounts with the Attendance Verification App.
2. **Event Creation and Synchronization**: Create corresponding events in the student's Google Calendar for each class and event added within the app. Ensure synchronization between the app and Google Calendar to reflect any changes made.
3. **Two-Way Synchronization**: Enable two-way synchronization between the app and Google Calendar. Any modifications made in either system should be reflected in the other, ensuring consistent and up-to-date schedules.
4. **Event Retrieval and Display**: Retrieve events from the student's Google Calendar and display them within the app's calendar view. Fetch event data using the Google Calendar API and render it in the appropriate sections of the UI.
5. **Reminders and Notifications**: Leverage Google Calendar's reminder and notification system to provide timely alerts for upcoming classes, quizzes, or other events.
