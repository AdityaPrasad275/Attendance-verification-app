# Attendance Verification App - Courses without Attendance Requirement and quizes Plan

## Goal

The goal of this feature is to enhance the Attendance Verification App by including courses that do not require attendance and integrating support for quizzes within the app.

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Course Creation and Enrollment**
    - Modify the course creation process to allow instructors to designate whether attendance is required for a particular course. This can be achieved through a checkbox or selection field during course creation.
    - Update the course enrollment process to enable students to enroll in courses that do not require attendance. Clearly differentiate between attendance-required and non-attendance-required courses in the user interface.
2. **Calendar Integration**
    - Enhance the calendar view to display both attendance-required and non-attendance-required courses, as well as quiz events. Use visual cues or color coding to differentiate between the different types of events.
    - Retrieve and display the schedule of non-attendance-required courses and quiz events from the database, ensuring accurate mapping to the calendar view.
3. **Event Management**
    - Extend the event management functionality to include the creation and management of quizzes within the app.
    - Allow instructors to create quizzes, define quiz details such as duration and question format, and associate quizzes with specific courses.
    - Enable students to access quizzes through their dashboard, attempt quizzes within a specified timeframe, and receive immediate feedback on their performance.
4. **User Interface**
    - Update the user interface to clearly indicate the distinction between attendance-required and non-attendance-required courses, as well as quiz events.
    - Provide intuitive navigation and visual cues to help users understand their course schedule and easily access quiz-related features.
5. **Documentation and Communication**
    - Update the [README.md](http://readme.md/) file to inform users and contributors about the new features of including courses without attendance requirements and integrating quizzes within the app.
    - Communicate the purpose and benefits of these features, emphasizing the improved flexibility and comprehensive course management experience they provide.

Please note that this plan outlines a future feature and may require further discussion and refinement during the development process. Contributions from developers interested in implementing this feature are highly encouraged.

Feel free to modify and expand on this plan according to your project's specific requirements and vision.
