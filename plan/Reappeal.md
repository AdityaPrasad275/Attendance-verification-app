# Attendance Verification App - Reappeal Feature Plan

## UI Design

### Student Interface

- Design a user-friendly interface for students to view their attendance records and initiate reappeal requests.
- Display a list of absent classes within a specific timeframe, such as the current week or previous week, indicating the date, time, and reason for the absence.
- Include a reappeal button or option for each absent class, allowing students to request a review of their attendance status.
- Provide a section to track the status of reappeal requests, including any updates or decisions made by the professor.
- Implement a notification system to alert students about the progress and outcome of their reappeal requests.

### Professor Interface

- Create an interface for professors to review and respond to student reappeal requests.
- Display a list of pending reappeal requests, including details such as the student name, absent class, and reason for the reappeal.
- Include options to accept or reject reappeal requests, with the ability to provide comments or supporting documentation.
- Implement a notification system to inform professors about new reappeal requests and any updates from students.

## Logic, Database Handling, and Verification

- Implement logic to handle the reappeal process, allowing students to request a review of their attendance for specific classes.
- Store reappeal requests in a secure and efficient database, associating them with the corresponding student, class, and timestamp information.
- Use appropriate data models and database schema to manage reappeal-related data efficiently.
- Implement mechanisms to validate and verify reappeal requests, ensuring that they are submitted within the specified time frame and contain necessary information.
- Handle the review and decision-making process by professors, allowing them to accept or reject reappeal requests based on supporting evidence and predefined criteria.
- Update attendance records based on the decisions made for reappeal requests, reflecting any changes in the student's attendance status.
- Implement notifications and updates to keep students informed about the progress and outcome of their reappeal requests.

## Reappeal Guidelines and Misuse Prevention

- Provide clear guidelines to students regarding the reappeal process, including the timeframe for submitting reappeal requests and the required supporting evidence.
- Educate students about the consequences of misusing the reappeal feature, emphasizing the importance of submitting genuine and valid requests.
- Implement mechanisms to detect and prevent misuse of the reappeal feature, such as analyzing patterns of reappeal requests or flagging suspicious activities.
- Regularly review and audit reappeal requests to ensure compliance with guidelines and identify any potential misuse.
- Enable professors to provide feedback or comments during the reappeal review process, facilitating clear communication and reducing the chances of misunderstandings or misuse.

Implementing a separate user interface specifically dedicated to the reappeal process can provide a clear and organized way for students to view their absent classes, submit reappeals, and track the status of their appeals. Here's an expanded overview of how this separate UI for reappeals could be structured:

1. Absent Classes Section:
    - The UI will display a section that lists the classes for which the student was marked absent within the current or previous week.
    - Each class session entry can include relevant details such as the course name, class date, and other necessary information.
    - An associated reappeal button will be available for each absent class, allowing the student to initiate an appeal for that specific class session.
2. Reappeal Submission:
    - When a student clicks the reappeal button for a particular class session, a form or dialog will open to collect the necessary details for the appeal.
    - The student can provide the reason for the absence, supporting documents if required, and any additional information requested.
    - After submitting the reappeal form, the app captures the appeal details, including the class session information, reason, and supporting documents.
3. Reappeal Status and Tracking:
    - The UI will include a section where students can view the status and progress of their reappeals.
    - Each reappeal entry will display relevant information such as the class session, the reason for the appeal, and the current status (e.g., pending, approved, denied).
    - Students can track the progress of their appeals and receive notifications or updates regarding the outcomes of their requests.
4. Notification and Updated Status:
    - The app will notify students about the outcome of their reappeal request, indicating whether it was approved or denied.
    - If the reappeal is approved, the attendance status for the specific class session will be updated in the database, marking the student as present.
    - Students can view the updated attendance status and any changes made to their attendance records within the app.
