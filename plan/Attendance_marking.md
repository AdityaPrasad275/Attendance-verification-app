## UI Design

### Professor Interface

- Design an intuitive interface for professors to monitor and verify student attendance.
- Display the class details, including the course name, class time, and current attendance status.
- Provide a list of enrolled students with options to mark attendance, view attendance history, and access student details.
- Include features for managing class cancellations, scheduling adjustments, and other class-related functions.

### Student Interface

- Create a user-friendly interface for students to mark their attendance.
- Display the class details, including the course name, class time, and current attendance status.
- Implement attendance marking options, such as buttons or QR code scanning, to capture entry and exit timestamps.
- Provide notifications or reminders for upcoming classes and pending attendance marking tasks.
- Include a section for students to view their attendance history, appeal attendance, and track their overall attendance percentage.

## Logic, Database Handling, and Verification

- Implement logic to validate attendance marking based on the proximity of professor and student locations during class time.
- Store attendance records in a secure and efficient database, associating them with the relevant class, student, and timestamp information.
- Use appropriate data models and database schema to manage attendance-related data efficiently.
- Implement verification mechanisms, such as comparing location coordinates or using Wi-Fi network data, to ensure accurate attendance records.
- Handle errors and exceptions during the attendance marking process to maintain data integrity and provide a smooth user experience.
- Integrate with external services or APIs for location verification, such as geolocation or Wi-Fi network APIs.
- Implement periodic synchronization or batch processing to update attendance records and handle real-time or near-real-time requirements based on your project's needs.
