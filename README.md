# Attendance Verification App

Welcome to the Attendance Verification App repository! This app aims to simplify the process of attendance marking, course scheduling, and student bookkeeping. By leveraging technology, it provides a convenient solution for both instructors and students.

## Non-Technical Users

If you're a non-technical user or someone who wants to understand the app's features and functionality without diving into the technical details, this section is for you.

### Features

The Attendance Verification App offers the following key features:

- **Class Creation**: Instructors can easily create and manage classes, set up schedules, and define attendance requirements.
- **Course Enrollment**: Students can browse available courses, enroll in desired classes, and manage their course schedule.
- **Attendance Marking**: Students can mark their attendance by comparing their location or Wi-Fi connection with the instructor's location, ensuring accurate and reliable attendance records.
- **Reappeal Feature**: Students can request a review of their attendance records for specific classes, providing a mechanism for addressing attendance-related concerns.

- **Google Calendar Integration**: Seamlessly sync class schedules and events with Google Calendar for enhanced calendar management.

Please refer to the detailed [plan](./plan) files for each feature to understand the goals and benefits they offer. These [plan](./plan) files are mainly oriented twoards technical contributors and provide a comprehensive overview of the features and their implementation details. A complete(slightly more indepth) overview can also be found [here](./plan/app.md)

### **Future Feature: Quizzes and Non-Attendance Requiring Classes**

In the future, we envision the possibility of expanding the Attendance Verification App to include quizzes and classes that do not require attendance. These additional features would enhance the app's functionality and provide a more comprehensive course management experience for both instructors and students.

### Quizzes

- Instructors would have the ability to create quizzes within the app, define quiz details such as duration and question format, and associate them with specific classes.
- Students would be able to access quizzes through their student dashboard, attempt them within a specified timeframe, and receive instant feedback on their performance.

### Non-Attendance Requiring Classes

- Non-attendance requiring classes would be included in the app to provide a complete overview of students' course schedules.
- These classes could represent self-paced courses, online courses, or classes that primarily focus on self-study.
- Students would be able to enroll in non-attendance requiring classes, access course materials, and track their progress through the app.

Please note that these features are not currently in focus of implmentation and are intended for future development. The addition of quizzes and non-attendance requiring classes would further enhance the functionality and versatility of the Attendance Verification App.
